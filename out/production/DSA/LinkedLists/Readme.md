Linkedlist always has head and tail, while Array only have index. 

Remove the last node take O(n) because it has to go over the whole list to set a tail to new pointer 

Adding to the first node take O(1)

Remove the first node take O(1) head = next.head.head

Adding to random node take O(n)

If looking for something by index, array is better choice
