## Def:
Devide the array into 2, and into 2, until there are all single array, 
And then, compare, and combine them together. 

##BigO:
###Space Complexity:

O(n) because we need to create the same amount of items

###Time Complexity:

O(logn) to split them out
O(n) to merge them together 

==> Totally, time is O(nlogn) --> Big time
