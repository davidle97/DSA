##Def:
Insertion Sort always start with the second item,
if it is less than item before it, switch to that item;
##BIG O:

if the array is almost sorted --> O(n);
Average time complexity is O(n^2)

##Usage: 
The array is almost sorted because: 
- Time complexity is O(n);
- Code is easy to write;

##Advantage: 
All Buble, Selection,and Insertion sort have O(1) space complexity
because all three sort the array in place. That means that they dont
create additional copies of the array.
