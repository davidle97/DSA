#GRAPH

### Vertex or Node 

Between Nodes are connected by Edge

A---->B---->C---->A

Edge canbe directional, or bi directional; 
Tree are formed of Graph, but one node only connect to 2 node 

Weight is the cost to go from A-> B
### Adjacency Matrix

### Adjacency List 
 

###Big O

Space O(v^2)

Time Complexity O(V+E)
ADD vertex O(1), remove the edge O(n)
